A training algorithm for GPT2 using methods from Adrej Karpathy lecture on Youtube. Basically a regular transformer with some tweaks to help a single GPU train on a large dataset. 
Dataset used for training was "Fineweb" which can be found from "https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu"
